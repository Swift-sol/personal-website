## Steps to collaborate

1. **Make a Fork** of the project.

   In the upper left corner of the page you will find a button, click on **Fork**.

2. On GitHub, **navigate to the Fork** that has been generated for you.

3. **Clone the project **.

   `` 
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/stuja
   `` 

4. **Create a branch**, thereby protecting the `master` branch.

   `` 
   git checkout -b "name-of-your-branch"
   `` '

5. **Contribute your improvements** to the project. 

6. **Save** the changes.

   ```bash
   git add.
   git commit -m "Description of the change you have made"
   ```
   
7. **Upload the changes** to GitHub.

   `` 
   git push origin "name-of-your-branch"
   `` 

8. On GitHub, **do a pull request** by clicking the *Compare & pull request* button.

9. In the new window, **describe the changes you have added** and point out why they are important.

10. **Send the pull request** by clicking *Create pull request*.
