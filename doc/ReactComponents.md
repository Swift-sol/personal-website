# Project structure 🧱

* `Component`. Here hang all the components that have a well defined function. They are:
  * `Blog`. Blog content manager
  * `Contact`. Contact Form
  * `Home`. Main information and links.
  * `Layout`. All pages have a common content, like: `NavBar` and specific content of the page. The work of the `Layout` is to group this information. 
  * `NavBar`. Menu superior. 
  * `PageNotFound`
  * `Resume`. Put your resume here.
  * `Work` Have you make some work and you wanna share it?
* `data`. Normally, you don't have to touch any of the logic of the website. Everything you want to add or modify must go here.
* `images`. Do you want to add an image to the project? Group them within this directory.
